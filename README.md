# ***Programming and Scripting Project***

_Author: Vanessa Lyra_

## **Project overview**
Investigate the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris dataset.  The goal for this project is to analyse and explore the dataset and it's relationships using Python.

## **Problem Statement**
1. Research and write a summary of the dataset.
2. Download the data set.
3. Output a summary of each variable to a .txt file.
4. Generate histograms of each variable to .PNG files
5. Generate scatter plots of each pair of variables.
6. Performs aditional relevant analysis.

## **About the dataset**

The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species (classes):
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each sample presents four features measured in cm:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## **Libraries and Tools**
Libraries used in this project:

- Scikit-learn: loading the Iris dataset 
- Pandas: analysis and data manipulation
- Numpy: mathematical operations
- Matplotlib: generate visualizations (scatterplots,histograms)
- Seaborn: statistical graphics.
- Sklearn.linear_model: performing regression line.

## **Project Structure**
README.md: The file contains dataset summary and project documentation.

analysis.py: A Python script containing analysis, visualizations, and outputs results.

project.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook to document the project analysis and visualizations and coding comments, any encountered issues and resources.

variable summary: .txt file generated to output a summary of each variable.

.PNG files: histograms of each variable.

## **Dataset summary:**

The dataset had been introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, containing 150 samples from three flower species: Setosa,Versicolor and Virginica (classes).  Each one of the samples contain four measured features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and width. The dataset is wildly used for educational purposes in machine learning and data analysis and statistics typically for classification tasks.

## **Analysis and Visualizations**

1. Exploring the dataset estructure
2. Summary of each variable.
3. Histograms of each variable.
4. Scatter Plots of each pair of variables.
5. Boxplots of each feature by class
6. Dataset Heatmap
7. Dataset Pairplot
8. Scatter Plots with simple linear regression
