About Fisherâ€™s Iris data set:

The dataset had been introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, containing 150 samples from three flower species (classes) - Setosa,Versicolor and Virginica. Each one of the samples contain four measured parts (features): Sepal and petal's length and width. The dataset is wildly used for educational purposes about machine learning and data analysis.

The columns in the dataset are: 
-SampleId
-SepalLengthCm
-SepalWidthCm
-PetalLengthCm
-PetalWidthCm
-Species
