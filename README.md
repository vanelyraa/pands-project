## **Dataset summary:**

The dataset had been introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, containing 150 samples from three flower species: Setosa,Versicolor and Virginica (classes).  Each one of the samples contain four measured features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and width. The dataset is wildly used for educational purposes in machine learning and data analysis and statistics typically for classification tasks.
